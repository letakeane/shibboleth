# üîê Shibboleth

Shibboleth is an app designed to verify two parties who don't already know each other that they are the correct, expected person.

## The Problem

Recently I got into a rideshare and the driver asked, "Leta?" and all I had to do was say "Yep!"

It got me thinking: it's difficult to verify that a stranger is the RIGHT stranger when you meet them.

## The Solution

"Shibboleth" is a word that refers to something from a culture that is a distinguishing feature of a group. It also has come to refer to a passphrase unique to that culture that identifies someone as a member of that group.

This app connects strangers and gives them a secret phrases to identify themselves to one another.
